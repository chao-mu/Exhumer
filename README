Exhumer is a framework for finding and extracting data from remote sources, someday supporting everything from SSH servers to Search Engines

PRE ALPHA EXPERIMENTAL VERSION! Don't expect anything at all to work.

Actual working examples:

ruby bin/hunt.rb modules/plunder/crypt.rb  modules/search/google.rb > search_results

Vapour examples of commands:

bin/hunt.rb presets/crypt --config foo.baz=bar,foo.qux=quux,refresh=true
# Search google and bing for crypt passwords, nmap command style. I like this.
exhumer -sG -sB --scripts crypt
